wxEDID - Extended Display Identification Data editor

 *********************
 * Required Packages *
 *********************

Debian-based distros:
To compile the program, the libwxgtkX.X-dev package is required.
(where X.X is the wxWidgets version)

The libwxgtkX.X-dev package has quite a lot of additional dependencies,
which are normally installed automatically with the libwxgtkX.X

After compilation the libwxgtkX.X-dev and related packages can be safely removed.

 ***************
 * Compilation *
 ***************

To compile the program use the following commands:

> cd <path to main project directory>
> configure
> make
> <sudo> make install

Full list of additional options for compilation process can be shown by invoking:
> configure --help

NOTE#1:
Since rcode v1.x the program sources have to be preprocessed using rcd_autogen script.
The rcd_autogen requires bash v4.4+, what shouldn't be a problem *unless* You're
using some very old distribution.
In such situation, it's still possible to compile the program:
> configure the source tree using distro with bash v4.4+ (f.e. in a VM)
The rcd_autogen will generate additional source files needed for the compilation.
Copy the configured (pre-processed) project directory to the target system and run:
> configure --enable-rcdgen-mode=skip
> make
> <sudo> make install

The above procedure allows also to re-package the project and re-distribute it without
rcd_autogen script (of course in such case the files generated by rcd_autogen have to be included)

NOTE#2:
> make clean
this deletes all the files generated by rcd_autogen, so after
issuing "make clean", trying to rebuild with make command will fail.
You have to run 'configure' again or directly the rcd_autogen script
with appropriate arguments -> this will regenerate necessary files.
